# Intermodulation Calculation
This script calculates the critical intermodulation frequencies in a given list of frequencies. See [this page](https://www.shure.com/en-US/performance-production/louder/all-about-wireless-intermodulation-distortion) for a good introduction on the topic

The default list is not particularly well optimized.

Whoever adds the capability to calculate a frequency set as intermodulation free as possible with given start and stop frequency, minimum spacing and number of frequencies is eligible for one (1) cookie, which can be picked up at my office.
